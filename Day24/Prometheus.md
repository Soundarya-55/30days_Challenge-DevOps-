## **🔍 Prometheus – Monitoring Tool Overview**

### ✅ **What is Prometheus?**

Prometheus is an **open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit**, designed for **scalable** and **dynamic** infrastructures like microservices and containerized apps.

---

### 📈 **Key Features:**

* **Pull-Based Model:**
  Scrapes metrics from targets at specified intervals (rather than receiving pushed data).

* **Time-Series Data:**
  Stores metrics with timestamps, labels, and values — ideal for trend analysis and alerting.

* **Powerful Query Language (PromQL):**
  Enables deep insights with complex queries over time-series data.

* **Alerting Support:**
  Native alerting system (Alertmanager) allows rules-based triggers with notifications to Slack, email, etc.

* **Visualizations:**
  Integrates easily with **Grafana** for custom dashboards.

* **Ecosystem of Exporters:**
  Collects metrics from:

  * System components (Node Exporter)
  * Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  * Web servers (Nginx, Apache)
  * Kubernetes, Docker, etc.

### 🧩 **Use Case Suitability:**

* Microservice architectures
* Kubernetes environments
* Cloud-native deployments
* DevOps monitoring pipelines

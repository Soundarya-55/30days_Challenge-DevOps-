# 🔧 Azure DevOps Overview

**Azure DevOps** is a comprehensive suite of development tools and services provided by Microsoft. It supports teams throughout the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** and enables **DevOps practices** such as **Continuous Integration (CI)**, **Continuous Delivery (CD)**, and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

## 🚀 Key Components of Azure DevOps

### 1. Azure Boards

* **Project tracking and management** with features like:

  * **Work Items**: User stories, bugs, tasks.
  * **Backlogs & Sprints**: For agile planning and tracking.
  * **Kanban Boards**: Visual workflow tracking (To Do → In Progress → Done).

### 2. Azure Repos

* **Version control system** supporting:

  * **Git Repos** (distributed)
  * **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)** (centralized)
* Includes pull requests, branching strategies, and code reviews.

### 3. Azure Pipelines

* Automates **build, test, and deployment** workflows.

  * **CI/CD**: Ensures code quality and quick releases.
  * **Supports**: Multiple languages, containers, Windows/Linux, Azure, AWS, Kubernetes.

### 4. Azure Test Plans

* **Manual and automated testing** platform.

  * Group test cases into **Test Suites**.
  * Integrates with test frameworks (NUnit, MSTest, Selenium).

### 5. Azure Artifacts

* Host and share packages (e.g., **NuGet, npm, Maven, Python**) in a private feed.
* Integrated with pipelines for **dependency management**.

### 6. Azure DevOps Services

* **Cloud-hosted** and **on-premises** (via Azure DevOps Server, formerly TFS).
* Supports global team collaboration with **scalable infrastructure**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts in Azure DevOps

### 🗃️ Version Control

* **Git**: Distributed system for team collaboration.
* **TFVC**: Centralized version control for larger teams.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

* **CI**: Code is frequently integrated, built, and tested.
* **CD**: Code is automatically released to environments (dev, staging, production).

### 📋 Work Item Tracking

* Manage user stories, tasks, and bugs with:

  * **Backlogs**
  * **Sprints**
  * **Kanban Boards**

### 📈 Agile Project Management

* Supports **Scrum** and **Kanban** frameworks.
* Work items organized into:

  * **Epics** → **Features** → **User Stories/Tasks**

### 🚀 Release Management

* Automate deployments to multiple environments.

  * Use **Environment Gates** and approval workflows.
  * Supports **blue-green**, **canary**, and **rolling deployments**.

### 🤝 Collaboration & Reporting

* Integrates with **Teams**, **Slack**, and others.
* Create **Dashboards**, **Reports**, and receive **Alerts** for updates and pipeline events.

### 💻 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Provision infrastructure using code via:

  * **Terraform**
  * **ARM Templates**
  * **Azure CLI**

## ✅ Benefits of Azure DevOps

* **End-to-End Lifecycle Management**: Covers planning → coding → testing → releasing.
* **Team Collaboration**: Connects devs, testers, and ops.
* **Automation**: Faster, consistent releases via pipelines.
* **Scalability**: Suitable for startups and enterprises alike.
* **Integration**: Seamlessly connects with Azure and third-party tools.

# Networking Fundamentals for DevOps Engineers

Networking basics are crucial for DevOps engineers to:
- Understand system communication,
- Troubleshoot issues effectively,
- Secure infrastructure,
- Automate processes,
- Optimize performance.

It fosters better collaboration between development and operations, especially in distributed systems.

## ðŸ“š Key Networking Concepts for DevOps Engineers

### 1. OSI Model
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes communication functions into **seven abstraction layers**.  
Each layer manages aspects like hardware, addressing, routing, and application-level interactions.

### 2. Protocols: TCP / UDP / IP
**Protocols** are rules for how data is transmitted and received across networks.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**  
  Connection-oriented, reliable delivery through sequencing and acknowledgment.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**  
  Connectionless, fast communication without guaranteed delivery â€” ideal for real-time apps (e.g., video streaming).

- **IP (Internet Protocol):**  
  Manages addressing and routing of data packets to ensure they reach the correct destination.

### 3. Ports
**Ports** direct network traffic to specific applications or services on devices, allowing multiple services to operate simultaneously on a single machine.

### 4. Subnetting
**Subnetting** divides a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets) to:
- Improve IP address utilization,
- Enhance security,
- Optimize routing.

Understanding **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** is essential for efficient IP address representation.

### 5. Routing
**Routing** determines how data packets travel across networks from a source to a destination.  
Routers use **routing tables** and **routing protocols** to find the best and most efficient paths.

### 6. DNS (Domain Name System)
**DNS** translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses.

It also:
- Locates mail servers,
- Balances web traffic,
- Redirects requests,
- Performs reverse lookups,
- Enhances performance with caching.

**Common DNS Record Types:**
- **A Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record:** Points one domain to another.
- **MX Record:** Specifies mail servers.
- **NS Record:** Identifies authoritative DNS servers.

### 7. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A **VPN** creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet â€” like a private tunnel â€” allowing:
- Safe remote access to servers,
- Secure maintenance of cloud infrastructure,
- Protection of sensitive data during remote operations.

### 8. Networking Tools

| Tool         | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Ping**     | Test connectivity to a host |
| **Traceroute** | Show the route and transit delays |
| **Netstat**  | Display active connections and routing tables |
| **Nmap**     | Discover hosts and services on a network |
| **Tcpdump**  | Capture and analyze network traffic |
| **Ipconfig/Ifconfig** | Show network configuration |
| **Dig**      | Query DNS servers |
| **Nslookup** | Resolve domain names to IPs |
| **Wireshark** | Deep network traffic analysis (protocol analyzer) |
| **Iperf**    | Measure TCP/UDP bandwidth performance |

- Build reliable, scalable systems,
- Automate infrastructure tasks effectively,
- Troubleshoot issues with precision,
- Secure communication across distributed systems.

Python and shell scripting are both used for automation, but they have key differences:

1. Purpose
Python: A high-level, general-purpose programming language used for automation, scripting, web development, data analysis, and more.
Shell Scripting: A command-line scripting language (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) primarily used for automating OS-level tasks.
2. Portability
Python: Cross-platform; works the same on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Shell Scripting: Depends on the OS (e.g., Bash for Linux/macOS, PowerShell for Windows).
3. Syntax and Readability
Python: More readable and structured, with support for OOP and modular programming.
Shell Scripting: More command-based, concise but harder to read for complex logic.
4. Libraries & Functionality
Python: Rich library support for data processing, networking, and automation.
Shell Scripting: Limited to OS commands but efficient for system tasks like file manipulation.
5. Execution Speed
Python: Slower than shell scripts for basic file operations but faster for complex logic.
Shell Scripting: Faster for simple system tasks but struggles with complex operations.
6. Use Cases
Python: Web development, automation, data analysis, AI/ML, and cloud computing.
Shell Scripting: Task automation, system administration, and batch processing.
When to Use What?
Use Python for complex tasks needing logic, data handling, or cross-platform support.
Use Shell Scripting for quick automation, OS management, and simple command execution.

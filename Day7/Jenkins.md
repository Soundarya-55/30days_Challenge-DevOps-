## What is Jenkins?
It’s an open-source automation server. It is possible to escalate the software development process with Jenkins automation. Throughout the life cycle, it helps you manage software delivery processes. Various life cycle stages include building, testing, documenting, packaging, staging, deployment, and more.

## What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration is a procedure to integrate all the code changes done by several developers in one project. A code is repeatedly tested after a commit to guarantee the code is error and bug-free.

## Why is Jenkins used in DevOps?
Jenkins is a valuable tool for DevOps engineers because it automates software builds, tests, and deployments, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), which leads to faster, more reliable software releases. 

## Features of Jenkins
Jenkins has some features that really sell it as a CI/CD tool. These are some of them:

Plugins
Easy to set up
Supports most environments
Open-source
Easy distribution

### Plugins
The availability of thousands of plugins allows for a large degree of customizability. The developers have the opportunity to integrate these plugins with development and testing tools, and tailor the architecture to serve a lot of possibilities.

### Easy to Set Up
Jenkins has executable packages that are quick to install on Windows, Mac and Unix operating systems. It’s just a self-contained Java program that you can set up in ten minutes.

### Supports Most Environments
Jenkins supports most environments, including cloud-based architecture. This makes it handy as teams begin to use different environments. It also supports all major cloud platforms, including Amazon, Azure, Google, and IBM Cloud.

### Open-source
Jenkins is open-source and free to use. It has an enthusiastic developer community that frequently holds in-person and online meetings.

### Easy Distribution
It’s easy to distribute Jenkins across work machines, which makes building, testing, and deployment faster.

### Security
Jenkins offers security tools to help organizations keep their data and systems safe, right out-of-the-box. This includes features like role-based access control, session management, and encryption. Additionally, Jenkins integrates with several security-related plugins to further enhance its security capabilities.

## How Jenkins works?
Jenkins works by automating the software development lifecycle through a pipeline-based approach, where it fetches code from repositories, builds the application, runs tests, manages artifacts, and deploys to production environments, all while integrating with various DevOps tools for monitoring and notifications.

### 🔹 **Core Features:**

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**

   * Track servers, containers, databases, and cloud services in real time.
   * View metrics like CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.

2. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

   * Trace application requests end-to-end across microservices.
   * Identify latency bottlenecks, slow DB queries, and code-level issues.

3. **Log Management**

   * Collect, filter, search, and analyze logs from any source.
   * Correlate logs with metrics and traces for root cause analysis.

4. **Synthetic Monitoring**

   * Simulate user traffic to monitor application uptime and performance.
   * Useful for proactive outage detection.

5. **Dashboards**

   * Custom, real-time dashboards for visualizing metrics and KPIs.
   * Prebuilt templates available for common services.

6. **Alerts & Incident Management**

   * Set threshold-based or anomaly-based alerts.
   * Integrates with Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, etc.

### 🧪 **Example Workflow:**

> Your application shows slower response times.
> Datadog APM traces the delay to a Redis call.
> Logs show retry errors.
> Infra metrics reveal high Redis CPU usage.
> Dashboard visualizes it all, and an alert was already sent.

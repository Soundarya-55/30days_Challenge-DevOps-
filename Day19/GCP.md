# 🌐 **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

GCP is a suite of cloud computing services by Google that provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and serverless computing. It allows organizations to build, deploy, and scale apps using the same infrastructure behind Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail.

---

### 🔧 **1. Compute Services**

* **Compute Engine**: Scalable virtual machines (VMs).
* **App Engine**: PaaS for building scalable web apps without managing servers.
* **Cloud Functions**: Lightweight, event-driven serverless functions (FaaS).
* **Cloud Run**: Run containers without managing infrastructure.
* **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration.

---

### 💾 **2. Storage & Databases**

* **Cloud Storage**: Object storage for media, backups, etc.
* **Cloud SQL**: Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
* **Cloud Spanner**: Globally distributed relational database.
* **Firestore / Datastore**: Serverless NoSQL document databases.
* **Bigtable**: Wide-column NoSQL for large analytical workloads.
* **Filestore**: High-performance file system for applications.

---

### 🌐 **3. Networking**

* **VPC**: Isolated virtual networks for GCP resources.
* **Cloud Load Balancing**: Global load distribution for high availability.
* **Cloud CDN**: Delivers content with low latency using Google’s edge network.
* **Cloud Interconnect**: Private network links to GCP.
* **Cloud NAT**: Enables internet access for private instances.

---

### 🔐 **4. Identity & Security**

* **Cloud IAM**: Role-based access control for GCP resources.
* **Cloud Identity**: User authentication and management.
* **KMS**: Secure key management and encryption.
* **Cloud Armor**: DDoS protection and WAF capabilities.
* **Security Command Center**: Security insights, threat detection, and compliance.

---

### 🛠️ **5. Developer Tools & DevOps**

* **Cloud Build**: CI/CD pipelines for build, test, and deployment.
* **Artifact Registry**: Stores container images and packages.
* **Cloud Source Repositories**: Git repositories hosted on GCP.
* **Operations Suite**: Monitoring, logging, tracing (formerly Stackdriver).

---

### 📊 **6. Data & Analytics**

* **BigQuery**: Serverless, fast data warehouse with SQL-like querying.
* **Dataflow**: Unified stream and batch processing with Apache Beam.
* **Dataproc**: Managed Hadoop/Spark clusters.
* **Pub/Sub**: Messaging service for event-driven systems.
* **Looker**: BI and data exploration platform.

---

### 🤖 **7. AI & Machine Learning**

* **Vertex AI**: End-to-end ML platform for building, training, and deploying models.
* **AutoML**: Easy custom ML model training with minimal code.
* **AI APIs**: Pre-trained APIs for vision, speech, text, and translation.

---

### 🔄 **8. Hybrid & Multi-Cloud**

* **Anthos**: Manage workloads across GCP, on-prem, and other clouds.
* **Migrate to GCP**: Tools to migrate VMs, databases, and apps from other platforms.
